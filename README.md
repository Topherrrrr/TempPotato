This is used to find the difference between two invoice logs. To use, copy the invoices and paste them into a new text file. After that, you can click "Sort Error Messages" to separate the IDs from the Error Messages. Select the file you just created and click "Parse File". This will create a new file called "Invoices.csv" in the same directory as the exe

Alternatively, if you wanted to compare the difference between two invoice files, you can click "Compare two files". To use, copy the most recent logs and name it "Newer Invoices", or something to identify that they are the most recent. Do the same for a previous log and name it "Older invoices". After that, click compare and it will show any new invoices that have appeared between the two runs.
